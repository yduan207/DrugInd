#Same drugs, different cost.
Compare downstream overall health expenditures among patients using different drugs for the same conditions.

##Introduction
Different prescription drugs can have indications for similar conditions. In clinical setttings, these drugs may be used indifferently despite nuances in their reported efficacy and safety profiles. However, no two drugs were created equal. Drugs with same indications and similar profiles of effectiveness and safety can vary in treatment quality in terms of symptom reduction, disease progression control, and adverse events. Better treatment quality can not only improve patients' quality of life, but also help reduce downstream healthcare expenditures. On the other hand, patients taking prescriptions who do not achieve expected treatment effect or experience bad adverse events would utilize more health services and cost more money to their family and to the system.
